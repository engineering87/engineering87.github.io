## Understanding the Basics of CQRS
When designing scalable and maintainable applications, one of the patterns that often comes up is Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). 
Itâ€™s a design philosophy that separates the reading and writing operations of an application, offering benefits like improved performance, clearer code, and flexibility in handling complex business logic.
In this article, we'll delve into CQRS concepts and see how to implement them in .NET with practical examples.

## Understanding the Basics of CQRS
At its core, CQRS is based on the idea that commands (actions that change the state of the system) and queries (actions that fetch data without altering the state) should not use the same model.
This separation helps you optimize each path for its specific purpose.
Imagine you're working on a product catalog system. The logic for adding a product (a command) can be quite different from retrieving product details (a query).
CQRS allows you to address these requirements independently, making your application easier to scale and maintain.

Another fundamental aspect for designing a microservices architecture is the need to make independent the data on which each microservice will interact, that is to design a correct subdivision of the data domain. 
𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗖𝗤𝗥𝗦) is an architectural scheme that separates models for reading and writing data. Mainly, one database should only ever be used by one service. 
CQRS fits perfectly into microservice architectures due to its inherent ability to scale and implicit concurrency management. On the other hand, it is not always trivial to apply this pattern, which certainly requires 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗻-𝗱𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻'𝘀 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻.

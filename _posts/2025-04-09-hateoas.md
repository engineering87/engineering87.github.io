# Understanding HATEOAS in RESTful APIs with C# and ASP.NET Core
While designing RESTful APIs, developers go through several stages of REST maturity. One of the most significant concepts to reach higher levels of maturity is **HATEOAS**, aka Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State. This helps clients navigate an API in a dynamic manner by following hypermedia links contained within responsesâ€”reducing tight coupling and enhancing discoverability.

## What is HATEOAS?
HATEOAS is a constraint in REST that dictates that a client only communicate with a RESTful service using hypermedia provided dynamically by the server. That is, each API response includes suitable links to the next available action.
